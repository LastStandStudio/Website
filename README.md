# Last Stand Studio Website

## Branches

We publish our source code to make this project work properly in 3 Major branches.

The [Master](https://github.com/LastStandStudio/Website/tree/master) is the "Release" branch, 
all the code in this branch is well tested for reliability as well as security. This branch needs to have production 
ready code at all times so it can be loaded directly from the server itself.

The [Beta](https://github.com/LastStandStudio/Website/tree/beta) branch is for testing cutting edge code that may or
may not have broken something somewhere for some reason. All the code from this branch will have been merged from
the development branch and then fine tuned for release.

The [Development](https://github.com/LastStandStudio/Website/tree/development) branch, where all of the cutting edge
code gets dumped into and where all of the pull request should be made to. Once the code here is functional and matured,
a merge request should be sent to the beta branch for pre-deployment preperations.
